Extreme dietary restrictions.

Before insulin was discovered in 1921, people often used to treat diabetes by going on extreme diets. People would often have very low carb and high fat calorie restricted diets, the allen diet was very popular around this time - a diet where people would often consume around 400-600 calories. The goal was to reduce sugar levels in the blood and urine in order to prolong life. However, this often lead to starvation and malnutrition.

Fasting.

Patients were sometimes fasted for extended periods to try to control glucose levels in the blood. This did help to reduce symptons however 
was not sustainable or a humane solution.

Herbal medicines.

In many cultures, diabetes was often treated with things such as herbal teas and medicines, however these did not work nor were they consistenly effective.

In conclusion:

For type 1 diabetes, which usually affects children or young adults, the prognosis was grim: most patients died within months to a few years of diagnosis. For type 2 diabetes, some people managed their condition longer with strict diets and lifestyle control.
