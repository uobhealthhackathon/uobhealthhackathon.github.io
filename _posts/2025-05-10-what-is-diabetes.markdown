Diabetes is a disease where you have high glucose levels in the blood (Hyperglycemia) due to insulin resistance or a lack of insulin. It can go too low (Hypoglycemia) if you have too much insulin.

There is type 1 diabetes, this is an irreversable type of diabetes where your immune cells attack the insulin producing cells in the pancreas, this makes type 1 count as an auto-immune condition.

Type 2 is a reversible type of diabetes usally caused by a bad diet, this can lead to insulin resistance where your cells don't use insulin properly.

Gestational diabetes diabetes is a type caused by pregnancy and it effects the way your cells process glucose.

Type 3c diabetes is caused by trauma or infection to the pancreas.

Alstrom syndrome is diabetes from genetics where both parents have the mutation.

Neonatal diabetes is when diabetes occours in people under 9 months of age.

Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is ussaly not genetic, if one parent carrys the gene, the offspring has a 50% chance of getting diabetes.
