Diabetes is a disease where you have high glucose levels in the blood (Hyperglycemia) due to insulin reesistance or a lack of insulin. It can go too low (Hypoglycemia) if you have too much insulin.

There is type 1 diabetes, this is an irreversable type of diabetes where your immune cells attack the insulin producing cells in the pancreas, this makes type 1 count as an autoimmune condition.

Type 2 is a reversable type of diabetes usally caused by a bad diet, this can lead to insulin resistance where your cells don't use insulin properly
