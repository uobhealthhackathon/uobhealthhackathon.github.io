title: "Using GenAI Responsibly"
---

### What is GenAI, and why would I use it?
Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses generative models (they use probability to talk about how likely things are), which learn underlying patterns in data, to generate new text, images, videos, and other such media. These have grown hugely in popularity and usage with the rise of tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Microsoft CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), and [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/). Many people find these useful for streamlining daily tasks, improving effiency in their jobs, and even creating memes. 

### If it does all that, why wouldn't I just use it for everything?!
Though they can be incredibly useful, using GenAI tools without being careful can have unexpected consequences and impacts. One example would be their predisposition to state **incorrect** information with incredible confidence - just look at how many "r"s ChatGPT thinks are in the word "Strawberry",

Clearly it's wrong here, and even worse - you won't necessarily get the same information if you ask the same question twice! Though it's easy to spot that it's not correct in this case, if you were asking it to do something more complex (for example, generating some code for you), you could easily miss a small bug that could cause issues later on. What if you asked it to generate a graph from some data for you? Without checking that it had accurately plotted your data, you wouldn't know for sure that it had - you can't just take what was generated at face value. [Just yesterday](https://www.legalcheek.com/2025/05/judge-fury-after-faaake-cases-cited-by-rookie-barrister-in-high-court/), a barrister in the UK was ordered to pay £2000 to a court defendant because they had accidentally quoted five _fake_ cases in what they had brought to the court. The judge said, 

> “I consider that it would have been negligent for this barrister, if she used AI and did not check it, to put that text into her pleading” 

(_whilst writing this, I had to make sure that it wasn't a GenAI story itself... but it's real, see: [https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2025/1040.html](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2025/1040.html) if you're interested._)

### Well then, how can I use it responsibly?

### What now?
