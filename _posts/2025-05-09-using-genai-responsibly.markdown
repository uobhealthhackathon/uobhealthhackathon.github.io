title: "Using GenAI Responsibly"
---

### What is GenAI, and why would I use it?
Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses generative models (they use probability to talk about how likely things are), which learn underlying patterns in data, to generate new text, images, videos, and other such media. These have grown hugely in popularity and usage with the rise of tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Microsoft CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), and [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/). Many people find these useful for streamlining daily tasks, improving effiency in their jobs, and even creating memes. 

### If it does all that, why wouldn't I just use it for everything?!
Though they can be incredibly useful, using GenAI tools without being careful can have unexpected consequences and impacts. One example would be their predisposition to state **incorrect** information with incredible confidence - just look at how many Rs ChatGPT thinks are in the word "Strawberry",
