title: "Using GenAI Responsibly"
---

### What is GenAI, and why would I use it?
Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses generative models (they use probability to talk about how likely things are), which learn underlying patterns in data, to generate new text, images, videos, and other such media. These have grown hugely in popularity and usage with the rise of tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Microsoft CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), and [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/). Many people find these useful for streamlining daily tasks, improving effiency in their jobs, and even creating memes. 

### If it does all that, why wouldn't I just use it for everything?!
Though they can be incredibly useful, using GenAI tools without being careful can have unexpected consequences and impacts. One example would be their predisposition to state **incorrect** information with incredible confidence - just look at how many "r"s ChatGPT thinks are in the word "Strawberry",

Clearly it's wrong here, and not only that, you won't necessarily get the same information if you ask the same question twice! Though it's easy to spot that it's not correct in this case, if you were asking it to do something more complex (for example, generating some code for you), you could easily miss a small bug that could cause issues later on. What if you asked it to generate a graph from some data for you? Without checking that it had accurately plotted your data, you wouldn't know for sure that it had - you can't just take what was generated at face value. 

[Just yesterday](https://www.legalcheek.com/2025/05/judge-fury-after-faaake-cases-cited-by-rookie-barrister-in-high-court/), a barrister in the UK was ordered to pay ¬£2000 to a court defendant because they had accidentally quoted five _fake_ cases in what they had brought to the court. The judge said, 

> I consider that it would have been negligent for this barrister, if she used AI and did not check it, to put that text into her pleading 

(_whilst writing this, I had to make sure that it wasn't a GenAI story itself... but it's real! See: [https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2025/1040.html](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2025/1040.html) if you're interested._)

### Well then, how can I use it responsibly?
Being aware of the pitfalls of GenAI will get you a long way in being responsible with it! Here are a couple of quick recommendations that you could try out:  
* Always check and verify the information it gives you - you can't be sure that what's it's saying is correct or truthful, or even if it's completely made up. 
* Make sure you're using it as a tool to assist you, rather than using it to do the job entirely. Don't develop an overreliance on it - if you can't explain what you use from it, you can't be sure what you're doing.
* Consider whether or not using a GenAI tool could lead to "learning loss". Even by using it for seemingly simple tasks (like using it as a search engine) or writing an email, you're no longer improving the required skills to perform that task. Usually (over time) you'd improve at stuff like creative writing, filtering information to find what's relevant, etc. - if you rely on GenAI for those things, you're not going to get better at them.
* Always attribute the relevant parts of your work to AI if you've used it, and if you're not sure of its' own sources - ask!
* Remember that whatever you use GenAI for, the responsiblity to verify and attribute the results always lies with **you**

In essence, make sure you're being critical and careful with GenAI tools, whilst remembering they can be a powerful tool in the right hands üíñ

### What now? 
As part of the hackathon, you're going to be able to use tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), as well as sources like [Diabetes UK](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes) to gather information about diabetes, and then present that information in your posts. Just make sure to take what you've read here into account, and use any GenAI tools responsibly ‚ò∫Ô∏è
