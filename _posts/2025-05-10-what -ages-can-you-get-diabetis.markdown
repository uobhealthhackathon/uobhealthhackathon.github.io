You can get diabetis at any age no matter what type it is either type 1 or type 2.Most people get type v1 diabetis when they are young.
The onset of diabetes is most common in people ages 45 to 64. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It usually appears after the age of 45-64 but can occur at any age.90% of people with diabetis in  the UK have type 2 . You can also get diabetis at birth.Type 1 diabetes is most commonly diagnosed in children between the ages of 4 to 6 and 10 to 14, but it can occur at any age.

Type 1 diabetes can develop in adults, often leading to misdiagnosis as Type 2 diabetes, and requires lifelong management with insulin therapy.
