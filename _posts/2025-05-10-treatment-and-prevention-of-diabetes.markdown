### introduction
treatment is aimed at minimizing the risks of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications by effective blood-glucose control and maintenance of glycated haemoglobin (HbAlc) at or below the target value set for each individual target

### treatment
Insulin is the main type of treatment for diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin like it usually would.And you can’t live without insulin as it helps you manage your blood sugar levels and prevent serious short or long-term health problems known as diabetes complications. So you’ll need daily insulin injections or even an insulin pump, a small device which you can attach to your body which releases insulin.Your body will respond better to the insulin if you’re healthy and active and it could help prevent insulin resistance which can make it harder to manage your blood sugar levels.
