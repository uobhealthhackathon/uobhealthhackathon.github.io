title: "What is diabetes, and how does it affect your body?"

<p>Diabetes is a condition where your body has too much glucose in the bloodstream. There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.
</p>

<p>Type one diabetes is when your body doesn't produce enough insulin. Insulin (C<sub>256</sub>H<sub>383</sub>N<sub>65</sub>O<sub>77</sub>S<sub>6</sub>) is a chemical made in the pancreas which is an organ in the human body located next to the stomach. The insulin signals cells throughout the body to absorb the glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) from the bloodstream. This allows the cells to have energy. The insulin helps to balance blood glucose levels and to store excess glucose in the liver.</p>

<p>Type two diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes glucose. This is the most common form of diabetes. People with type two diabetes have a gradual decline in insulin production and their body doesn't use insulin effectively. This leads to high blood sugar levels.</p>
