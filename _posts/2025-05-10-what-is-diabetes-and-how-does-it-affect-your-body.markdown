<p>Diabetes is a condition where your body has too much glucose in the bloodstream. There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.
</p>

<p>Type one diabetes is when your body doesn't produce enough insulin. Insulin (C<sub>256</sub>H<sub>383</sub>N<sub>65</sub>O<sub>77</sub>S<sub>6</sub>) is a chemical made in the pancreas which is an organ in the human body located next to the stomach. The insulin signals cells throughout the body to absorb the glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) from the bloodstream. This allows the cells to have energy. The insulin helps to balance blood glucose levels and to store excess glucose in the liver.</p>

<p>Type two diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes glucose. This is the most common form of diabetes. People with type two diabetes have a gradual decline in insulin production and their body doesn't use insulin effectively. This leads to high blood sugar levels. However, peole can take in insulin externally to help lower their blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels can be tested using finger prick tests and monitors.</p>
