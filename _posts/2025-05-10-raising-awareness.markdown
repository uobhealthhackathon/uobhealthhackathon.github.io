What is diabetes?
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.

What are the two types called and what are the differences?
Type 1 diabetes – a lifelong condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.
Type 2 diabetes – where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin properly.
Some facts about diabetes:
- Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, over 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.
- High blood sugar that develops during pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes. It usually goes away after giving birth

Causes of diabetes:
-The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).
- When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.
- However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly.

Reducing the risk of diabetes:
Type 1- There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes.
Type 2- You can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight.

What makes you more at risk to getting type 2 diabetes?
- are living with overweight or obesity
- do not have a healthy diet
- have a family history of type 2 diabetes
- are of Asian, Black African or African Caribbean origin
- take certain medicines such as steroids for a long time
- have high blood pressure
- have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy
