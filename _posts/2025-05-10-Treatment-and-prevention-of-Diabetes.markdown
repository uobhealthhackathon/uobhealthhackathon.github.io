## Treatment

#### Type 1

Use of insulin is one way to treat Type 1 diabetes however it will never fully go away; there are several different types of insulin which ranges from rapid action insulin - that starts working in 15 minutes- to long-acting insulin which releases insulin into your body over  along period of time.

Another treatment to Type 1 diabetes is regular monitoring which is useful to help prevent hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia as it shows you your blood glucose level so you can react properly to either extremes. Again, like the insulin this does not remove or cure diabetes it just makes it less dangerous and deadly for your body.

Another treatment could be lifestyle changes as exercising and going on a diet massively helps you to prevent getting harmed by diabetes as it lowers chances of hyper or hypoglycaemia.

#### Type 2

Many treatments are similiar to type 1 diabetes however one of the first medication one is give is Metformin. Metformin works by reducing production of glucose in the liver and increase insulin sensitivity. There is also oral medication such as sulfonylureas which stimulates the pancreas to increase insulin production.


## Prevention

#### Type 2

Ways you can prevent type 2 diabetes is by having a healthy diet and exercising as it improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, if you smoke or drink you are more likely to obtain type 2 diabetes as it not only increases blood sugar level it also leads to insulin resistance which causes your body not to correctly respond to insulin leading to it being much less effective. 

#### Type 1 

Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented as it is an auto-immune disorder you have since birth where ur immune system kills cells that create insulin producing cells in the pancreas meaning (as of now) it cannot be prevented.


## Conclusion

To conclude, there are several treatments for both type 1 and 2 diabetes such as user of insulin and/or having a healthy lifestyle and diet. However, as of now there is no cure for both types of diabetes and no way to prevent type 1 diabetes, but type 2 diabetes can be prevented via exercise and a healthy diet.
