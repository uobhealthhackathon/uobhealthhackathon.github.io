There are many reasons and ways people can develop diabetes. But today i will tell you the main scientific reason why people develop diabetes. That is because their body cannot make enough insulin and the pancreas gets tired always producing insulin. Another reason is that your body starts to ignore the insulin that is being produced. 
Insulin is a hormone that regulates the bloods glucose levels. Without it glucose can accumulate in the blood and cause problems to an individual mentally and physically. 
Lastly, diabetes can occur because of genetics and because of poor lifestyle choices.
