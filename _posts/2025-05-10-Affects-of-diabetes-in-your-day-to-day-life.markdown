### Introduction: 
There a various types of diabetes, the main ones are type 1, type 2 and a rarer one is Gestational. This post focuses on the main 2 types being type 1 and type 2 and the effect it has ono a persons day to day life. This blog will be concentrating on Type 1 diabetes

### Type 1:
For a statistic type 1 is approximately 8% of the total diabetes population and there is no known cure for this condition.
Therefore the effect on a persons life with with Type 1 is significant. Type 1 is also a condition that occurs in young people and there are situations where a person can be born with this condition. In simplistic terms the body does not produce its own insulin inorder to produce energy and the necessary connections to the brain to ensure everyday movements, walking eating etc. A a person with Type 1 they have to have frequent dosage of insulin daily into thier bodies in order to survive.

You can see that the effect this has on their lives is huge and means constant medical intervention and diet control. The younger the person is of course impinges on the parents / guardians of the person which in turn effects their normal working lives. There is also the need for a high level of intervention from the Health sector, normally hospitals. As the person gets older they, with help, learn on how to monitor and look after themselves but over a time people with Type 1 can lead normal fulfilling lives. For example 5 times Olympic Gold Champion Steve Redgrave has Type 1 diabetes.

A person with Type 1 has to constantly monitor what they eat, measure glucose levels and adjust insulin levels all day long for LIFE.
Over time monitoring has become easier with the introduction of glucose flash monitoring equipment, use of insulin pumps and the new latest closed loop insulin pumps. However this technology still does not stop instances of hypos and hypers which in either case can be life threatening. Medications have to be taken everywhere by the person in case of complications. There is always a stigma with any type of diabetes but not so much regarding Type 1 as it is a life threatening condition. This is not the case with Type 2 as people become labelled as being fat, bad eating habits etc but this is not always the case.
